- In the Game, you are asked to accept or decline data collection on a dedicated **consent screen**.
- You may **withdraw your consent at any time** in the Game settings under **“Privacy settings”** or an equivalent option.
- When consent is withdrawn, we stop collecting analytics data going forward.

In a limited scope, we may rely on our legitimate interest in:

- For a limited time after you stop using the Game (typically **no longer than 12 months**) for:
  - diagnostics and analytics,
  - handling complaints and technical support,
  - maintaining security and integrity of our services.

After this period, data is deleted, anonymized, or aggregated where possible.
